<h1>Network Security Groups (NSGs) and Inspecting Traffic Between Azure Virtual Machines</h1>
In this tutorial, we observe various network traffic to and from Azure Virtual Machines with Wireshark as well as experiment with Network Security Groups. <br />

<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Compute)
- Microsoft Remote Desktop
- Command-Line Tools
- Network Protocols (SSH, RDP, DNS, HTTP/HTTPS, ICMP)
- Wireshark (Protocol Analyzer)

<h2>Operating Systems Used </h2>

- Windows 10
- Ubuntu Server 20.04

<h2>High-Level Steps</h2>

- Create VM (Windows and Ubuntu Server [Linux])
- Download, Install, and Run Wireshark
- PowerShell (Ping)
- Monitor Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) Traffic
- Change VM-2's Firewall Settings and View Changes in PowerShell + Wireshark
- Connect to VM-2 via SecureShell Protocol (SSH) and Monitor SSH Traffic on Wireshark
- Monitor Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) Traffic
- Monitor Domain Name System (DNS) Traffic

<h2>Actions and Observations</h2>

</p>
<p> Create two Virtual Machines (VMs) in Microsoft Azure. VM-1 will have Operating System (OS) of Windows 10 with the size of 2 virtual computer processing units (vcpus) and 18 GiB memory. VM-2 will have OS of Ubuntu also known as Linux with the 2vcpus and 16 GiB memory. (Make sure the virtual network matches VM-1's.)
</p>

</p>
<p> Connect to VM-1. Download Wireshark from the Internet, and install it with default settings. Run Wireshark. Choose Ethernet. Select the shark fin icon. 
</p>
<br />

</p>
<p> Here we can view the different protocol traffic taking place. On the tool bar, type "ICMP". It will filter the Internet Control Message Protocol only. 
</p>
<br />

</p>
<p> Collect VM-2's private ip address (10.0.0.5). In VM-1, open up Power Shell. Type "ping 10.0.0.5" and hit Enter (or Return). VM-1 communicated with VM-2. Returning to Wireshark, we can view this traffic. 
</p>

</p>
<p> Go to Network Security Groups in Microsoft Azure. Select VM-2. In the Inbound Security Rules, Add Rule. Source: Any, Source Port Range: Any (*), Destination: Any, Service: Custom, Destination Port: Protocol ICMP, Action: Denied, Priority: 200, Name: DenyAnyCustomAnyInbound. (Priority is set at 200 to affect before the SSH protocol.)

</p>
<p> Go to VM-1. View how changing VM-2’s Firewall affected PowerShell and Wireshark. (PowerShell - Request Timed Out. Wireshark - No Response Found)
</p>

</p>
<p> Go back to the Network Security Groups in Microsoft Azure. Select VM-2. In the Inbound Security Rules, change DenyAnyCustomInbound rule to Allow ICMP traffic, or delete DenyAnyCustomInbound rule. Return to PowerShell and Wireshark to view the changes. 
</p>
<br />

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/p9gXn3T.png" height="70%" width="70%" alt="Connecting to VM-2 Through SSH"/>
</p>
<p> Connect to VM-2 with SSH. Go to Wireshark and change the filter from ICMP to SSH. In PowerShell, type ssh (username created in VM-2)@(VM-2's private ip address). For instance, ssh labuser@10.0.0.5. When prompted to continue connecting, select yes. The next “PS C:\Users\labuser” enter Password created in VM-2. (Note: Your password may not be visible.)
</p>
<br />

<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/oAL48Je.png" height="70%" width="70%" alt="SSH Traffic"/>
</p>
<p> Following the connection to the Ubuntu (Linux) Server, there is a Linux command line "labuser@VM-2: $". Using Linux commands such as "id", "uname -a", and "ls -lasth", we can view this SSH traffic in Wireshark. 
</p>
<br />

<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/vLd8e8A.png" height="50%" width="50%" alt="Exit VM-2"/>
</p>
<p> To exit out of VM-2, in the command line type "exit" and click Enter (or Return). The Linux command line returns to Vm-1's Window's Command Line of "PS C:\Users\labuser>". 
</p>
<br />

</p>
<p> Monitor DHCP traffic. In Wireshark (VM-1), change the filter from SSH to DHCP. In PowerShell, type "ipconfig /renew". Then, click back into Wireshark to view the DHCP traffic. 
</p>
<br />

</p>
<p> Monitor DNS Traffic. In Wireshark (VM-1), change the filter from DHCP to DNS. In PowerShell, type "nslookup google.com". Then, go back to Wireshark to view the DNS traffic.
